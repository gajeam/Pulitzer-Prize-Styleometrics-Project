A state initiative that would allow adults to buy and consume marijuana for fun, while bringing the state’s famed pot industry fully <rule1m>out of the shadows</rule1m>, won Tuesday amid a national legalization push aimed at <rule1m>harvesting tax revenue</rule1m> and curbing arrests that have <rule2>consistently</rule2> diverged <rile1m>along racial lines</rule1m>.

Voters approved Proposition 64, also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, six years after a similar measure fell at the ballot box. It means California will set up an elaborate regulatory system for recreational pot — with a 15 percent excise tax on retail sales — and become the closely watched center of a national cannabis experiment.

<rule4>The results were <rule1m>met with muted cheers</rule1m> Tuesday night at a gathering of marijuana activists in the uptown Oakland bar The New Parish, where joints and bowls were passed around half in celebration and half in shock over the <rule1m>presidential race</rule1m></rule4>.

“Twenty years ago we started the job with Proposition 215, and tonight we finished the job,” said Dale Gieringer, the California director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana, or <rule5>NORML</rule5>.

<rule4>The measure was <rule1m>pushed hard</rule1m> by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom who walked through a fog of marijuana smoke at Verso, a nightclub on Mission Street, and declared victory</rule4>. “A few years ago, folks thought this was probably not likely to happen,” Newsom said. “There are a million people right now — literally one million people in the state of California — whose lives have been <rule2>profoundly</rule2> changed.”

Under <rule5>Prop. 64</rule5>, people 21 and older will be allowed to use and possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow as many as six plants for personal use — though smoking in public will remain illegal. The new market will generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue, according to the measure’s proponents, money earmarked for research and regulation and programs to protect children and the environment.

<rule1m>The push for</rule1m> decriminalization sparked debate among lawmakers, <rule2>educators</rule2>, police and doctors as well as pot smokers and growers. Supporters said marijuana is so ubiquitous that it might as well be legal, allowing the state to control it, tax it and ensure safe joints, extracts and edibles. A drop in arrests, they said, would ease the disparate punishment of people of color for using and selling pot.

But critics claimed that legalization would drive more drug use, <rule1m>fill the roads with pot-addled drivers</rule1m> and give teenagers easier access to the drug.

They vowed to Tuesday to continue fighting to limit advertising, ban home delivery of marijuana products and develop standards for impaired driving.

“The real <rule1m>battle</rule1m> will be in the legislature and how the details of the regulations are worked out,” said Andrew Acosta, the spokesman for the the No on 64 campaign. “The flaws in the initiative are going to need to be fixed.”

California was one of nine states voting Tuesday on ballot measures to loosen restrictions on marijuana, and one of five states considering recreational use. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia have already legalized adult use of the drug.

The question on many people’s minds was how closely California would follow the leads of Colorado and Washington, which in 2012 became the first states to approve recreational use.

There have been <rule1m>growing pains</rule1m> in Colorado, with critics of legalization citing increased hospital visits related to marijuana and alleged increases in youth smoking and stoned driving. In Washington, lawmakers shut down all medical pot clubs <rule1m>to make way</rule1m> for a tightly controlled roster of tax-paying retail stores, raising fears among those partial to the current medical-marijuana system that the 1,600 dispensaries in California may not survive under Prop. 64.

The California initiative — heavily funded by billionaire tech investor and philanthropist Sean Parker — received $24.7 million from 785 <rule2>contributions</rule2>. The opposition raised $1.6 million from 87 <rule2>contributions</rule2>. <rule5>Prop. 64</rule5> will allow stores to be licensed as a medical dispensary, a nonmedical retailer, or a hybrid of the two. All customers will pay the 15 percent excise tax, with only recreational customers required to pay sales taxes.

While many dispensary operators saw the potential for huge profits, growers in the Emerald Triangle of Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties made no secret of their concern that the proposed law would favor venture capitalists over small farmers. The issue peaked this summer when high rollers snapped up ranches, logging tracts and forested parcels in Humboldt County, which was the first county in the state to adopt a commercial marijuana land-use ordinance.

Supporters of <rule5>Prop. 64</rule5> countered that it would delay for five years the issuance of licenses to people who plan to grow 22,000 square feet or more of marijuana. That’s not enough, said many residents of the Emerald Triangle, where pot <rule1m>prices have dropped</rule1m> from about $3,200 a pound a decade ago to between $1,200 and $1,600 today. The 600-member California Growers Association was split on whether to endorse <rule5>Prop. 64</rule5>.

In <rule1m>law enforcement circles</rule1m>, there was concern about more Californians getting behind the wheel after consuming cannabis. The measure would maintain laws against driving stoned, but says nothing about how officers would detect a high motorist.

<rule1m>A pivotal point of debate</rule1m> was whether legalization would prompt more teenagers to get high.

<rule5>Prop. 64</rule5> prohibits the selling or marketing of marijuana to people under 21 and bans symbols, language, music or cartoon characters known to appeal to young people. Opponents, though, said a free-market system for any product is inherently motivated to build its customer base, and, legal or not, that base would inevitably include teenagers.
