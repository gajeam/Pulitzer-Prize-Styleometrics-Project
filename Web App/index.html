      var bostonglobe = "We\'re entering a new era of race relations in America -- a crazy, conflicting, potentially explosive era yet to be named.Maybe it\'s an era of white insecurity about racial identity as the country moves toward a nonwhite majority. Dylann Roof, who murdered nine black people in a church, and Rachel Dolezal, who declared herself black on national television, could be two sides of that coin.Or maybe it\'s an era of increasing black confidence. What\'s unprecedented about the spate of black people who\'ve died in police custody is not the deaths themselves -- those are sadly not new -- but rather the fact that they\'re being covered prominently on national news.There\'s something else notable about our conversations on race today: the disconnect between where we are in 2015 and where we thought we\'d be. The half-finished project of racial equality in the United States leaves us with a parade of endless contradictions.We overwhelmingly support the idea of integration. Yet, 75 percent of white people don\'t have a single black friend, and 66 percent of black people don\'t have a white one.We elected a black president. Yet we still incarcerate blacks at nearly six times the rate of whites. We\'ve had not one but two black secretaries of state. Yet, a study shows that women with \"black-sounding\" names -- like Lakisha and Aisha -- still have a hard time getting hired as secretaries.On television, the most powerful woman in the world is a black woman, Olivia Pope, who speaks her mind to the president of the United States on ABC\'s \"Scandal.\" In real life, black women like Sandra Bland and Ersula Ore get arrested for speaking their minds to white police officers.Where does that leave us, America? Slavery is over. Jim Crow, as our parents knew it, has ended. The civil rights movement is ancient history to kids today. Even the era of race-based remedies -- court-ordered busing, affirmative action, majority-minority political districts -- is fading. What happens next? After Barack Obama\'s election, some declared that we\'d reached a \"post-racial\" age. That we\'d finally given up, in the words of Chief Justice John Roberts, this \"sordid business\" of divvying ourselves up by race. Then we got Trayvon Martin. We got Ferguson. We got Baltimore. Today, Americans are talking more about race -- and doing more divvying -- than they have in years.The thing about this new era, however, is that we don\'t agree any more on what race means. In Martin Luther King Jr.\'s day, everybody knew that blacks were treated as second-class citizens. Today, half the country complains that being black gets you killed, while the other half complains that it gets you into college.In the past, stereotypes of black poverty were the problem. Today, it\'s stereotypes of black success. The black faces on television today drive luxury cars. They live in the White House. Nearly 60 percent of whites believe that blacks earn the same salaries as whites. Three percent think blacks actually earn more. In reality, the median household income for whites is $54,000, compared with $32,000 for blacks and $38,000 for Hispanics, a disparity that has grown since the 1970s. Meanwhile, the median net worth of a white family is $142,000. For Hispanics, it\'s just $13,700. For blacks, it\'s $11,000.Despite decades of government policies aimed at leveling the playing field, significant disparities remain. That\'s a source of outrage among blacks. Yet, enough black people have climbed the ladder to wealth and influence that we have the illusion of equality. That\'s left whites outraged at policies that still tip the scales in favor of one race.Therein lies the deepest disconnect: A majority of whites don\'t believe racism still exists. Or they suspect they\'re the real victims of it. A study by Tufts researchers showed that most whites agree that blacks faced serious racism in the past but feel that \"anti-white bias\" has become the bigger problem in the past 15 years.This is the unfinished business of the \'60s and \'70s. The most ambitious and far-reaching government effort to bring us together -- court-ordered desegregation of schools - was supposed to connect us, and make us equal. Race was supposed to disappear as a salient factor in American life.But it hasn\'t. Today, most blacks in Boston still lack quality schools, while many whites still resent the government takeover of schools. The life expectancy for residents in parts of the Back Bay is 91.9 years, compared with 58.9 years in parts of Roxbury. The struggle for equality hasn\'t been won. Yet many people feel exhausted. They want to declare victory (or defeat) and go home.Over the next few months, I\'ll explore how the history of desegregation shaped the era we\'re living in today. But first, let\'s give this era a name."
      var sfchron = 'Pot goes farm-to-table this harvest season\nMax Savage Levenson, SF Chronicle\n\nA state initiative that would allow adults to buy and consume marijuana for fun, while bringing the state\' famed pot industry fully out of the shadows, won Tuesday amid a national legalization push aimed at harvesting tax revenue and curbing arrests that have consistently diverged along racial lines.\n\nVoters approved Proposition 64, also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, six years after a similar measure fell at the ballot box. It means California will set up an elaborate regulatory system for recreational pot -- with a 15 percent excise tax on retail sales -- and become the closely watched center of a national cannabis experiment.\n\nThe results were met with muted cheers Tuesday night at a gathering of marijuana activists in the uptown Oakland bar The New Parish, where joints and bowls were passed around half in celebration and half in shock over the presidential race.\n\n\"Twenty years ago we started the job with Proposition 215, and tonight we finished the job,\" said Dale Gieringer, the California director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana, or NORML.\n\nThe measure was pushed hard by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom who walked through a fog of marijuana smoke at Verso, a nightclub on Mission Street, and declared victory. \"A few years ago, folks thought this was probably not likely to happen,\" Newsom said. \"There are a million people right now -- literally one million people in the state of California -- whose lives have been profoundly changed.\"\n\nUnder Prop. 64, people 21 and older will be allowed to use and possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow as many as six plants for personal use -- though smoking in public will remain illegal. The new market will generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue, according to the measure\' proponents, money earmarked for research and regulation and programs to protect children and the environment.\n\nThe push for decriminalization sparked debate among lawmakers, educators, police and doctors as well as pot smokers and growers. Supporters said marijuana is so ubiquitous that it might as well be legal, allowing the state to control it, tax it and ensure safe joints, extracts and edibles. A drop in arrests, they said, would ease the disparate punishment of people of color for using and selling pot.\n\nBut critics claimed that legalization would drive more drug use, fill the roads with pot-addled drivers and give teenagers easier access to the drug.\n\nThey vowed to Tuesday to continue fighting to limit advertising, ban home delivery of marijuana products and develop standards for impaired driving.\n\n\"The real battle will be in the legislature and how the details of the regulations are worked out,\" said Andrew Acosta, the spokesman for the the No on 64 campaign. \"The flaws in the initiative are going to need to be fixed.\"\n\nCalifornia was one of nine states voting Tuesday on ballot measures to loosen restrictions on marijuana, and one of five states considering recreational use. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia have already legalized adult use of the drug.\n\nThe question on many people\' minds was how closely California would follow the leads of Colorado and Washington, which in 2012 became the first states to approve recreational use.\n\nThere have been growing pains in Colorado, with critics of legalization citing increased hospital visits related to marijuana and alleged increases in youth smoking and stoned driving. In Washington, lawmakers shut down all medical pot clubs to make way for a tightly controlled roster of tax-paying retail stores, raising fears among those partial to the current medical-marijuana system that the 1,600 dispensaries in California may not survive under Prop. 64.\n\nThe California initiative -- heavily funded by billionaire tech investor and philanthropist Sean Parker -- received $24.7 million from 785 contributions. The opposition raised $1.6 million from 87 contributions. Prop. 64 will allow stores to be licensed as a medical dispensary, a nonmedical retailer, or a hybrid of the two. All customers will pay the 15 percent excise tax, with only recreational customers required to pay sales taxes.\n\nWhile many dispensary operators saw the potential for huge profits, growers in the Emerald Triangle of Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties made no secret of their concern that the proposed law would favor venture capitalists over small farmers. The issue peaked this summer when high rollers snapped up ranches, logging tracts and forested parcels in Humboldt County, which was the first county in the state to adopt a commercial marijuana land-use ordinance.\n\nSupporters of Prop. 64 countered that it would delay for five years the issuance of licenses to people who plan to grow 22,000 square feet or more of marijuana. That\' not enough, said many residents of the Emerald Triangle, where pot prices have dropped from about $3,200 a pound a decade ago to between $1,200 and $1,600 today. The 600-member California Growers Association was split on whether to endorse Prop. 64.\n\nIn law enforcement circles, there was concern about more Californians getting behind the wheel after consuming cannabis. The measure would maintain laws against driving stoned, but says nothing about how officers would detect a high motorist.\n\nA pivotal point of debate was whether legalization would prompt more teenagers to get high.\n\nProp. 64 prohibits the selling or marketing of marijuana to people under 21 and bans symbols, language, music or cartoon characters known to appeal to young people. Opponents, though, said a free-market system for any product is inherently motivated to build its customer base, and, legal or not, that base would inevitably include teenagers.\n'
      var pulitzer = "The GOP Deserves to Lose\nBy Bret Stephens (Pulitzer Prize Winner, The Wall Street Journal)\n\nLet's just say right now what voters will be saying in November, once Barack Obama has been re-elected: Republicans deserve to lose.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter that Mr. Obama can\'t get the economy out of second gear. It doesn\'t matter that he cynically betrayed his core promise as a candidate to be a unifying president. It doesn\'t matter that he keeps blaming Bush. It doesn\'t matter that he thinks ATMs are weapons of employment destruction. It doesn\'t matter that Tim Geithner remains secretary of Treasury. It doesn\'t matter that the result of his \"reset\" with Russia is Moscow selling fighter jets to Damascus. It doesn\'t matter that the Obama name is synonymous with the most unpopular law in memory. It doesn\'t matter that his wife thinks America doesn\'t deserve him. It doesn\'t matter that the Evel Knievel theory of fiscal stimulus isn\'t going to make it over the Snake River Canyon of debt.\n\nAbove all, it doesn\'t matter that Americans are generally eager to send Mr. Obama packing. All they need is to be reasonably sure that the alternative won\'t be another fiasco. But they can\'t be reasonably sure, so it\' going to be four more years of the disappointment you already know.\n\nAs for the current GOP field, it\' like confronting a terminal diagnosis. There may be an apparent range of treatments: conventional (Romney), experimental (Gingrich), homeopathic (Paul) or prayerful (Santorum). But none will avail you in the end. Just try to exit laughing.\n\nThat\' my theory for why South Carolina gave Newt Gingrich his big primary win on Saturday: Voters instinctively prefer the idea of an entertaining Newt-Obama contest -- the aspiring Caesar versus the failed Redeemer -- over a dreary Mitt-Obama one. The problem is that voters also know that Gaius Gingrich is liable to deliver his prime-time speeches in purple toga while holding tight to darling Messalina\' -- sorry, Callista\' -- bejeweled fingers. A primary ballot for Mr. Gingrich is a vote for an entertaining election, not a Republican in the White House.\n\nThen there is Mitt Romney, even now the presumptive nominee. If Mr. Gingrich demonstrated his unfitness to be a serious Republican nominee with his destructive attacks on private equity (a prime legacy of the Reagan years), Mr. Romney has demonstrated his unfitness by -- where to start?\n\nOh, yes, the moment in last week\' debate when Mr. Romney equivocated about releasing his tax returns. The former Massachusetts governor is nothing if not a scripted politician, and the least one can ask of such people is that they should know their lines by heart. Did nobody in Mr. Romney\' expensive campaign shop tell him that this question was sure to come, and that a decision had to be made, in advance, as to what the answer would be? Great CEOs don\'t just surround themselves with consultants and advance men. They also hire contrarians, alter egos and at least someone who isn\'t afraid to poke a finger in their chest. On the evidence of his campaign, Mr. Romney is a lousy CEO.\n\nBut it\' worse than that. The usual rap on Mr. Romney is that he\' robotic, but the real reason he can\'t gain traction with voters is that they suspect he\' concealing some unnameable private doubt. Al Gore and George Bush Sr. were like that, too, and not just because they were all to the proverbial manor born. It\' that they were basically hollow men.\n\nThus the core difference between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama: For the governor, the convictions are the veneer. For the president, the pragmatism is. Voters always see through this. They usually prefer the man who stands for something.\n\nWhat about Rick Santorum and Ron Paul? They are owed some respect, especially for the contrast between their willingness to take a stand for principle against the front-runners\' willingness to say anything. But Messrs. Santorum and Paul are two tedious men, deep in conversation with some country that\' not quite America, appealing to a devoted base but not beyond it. Sorry, gentlemen: You\'re not going anywhere.\n\nFinally, there are the men not in the field: Mitch Daniels, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Haley Barbour. This was the GOP A-Team, the guys who should have showed up to the first debate but didn\'t because running for president is hard and the spouses were reluctant. Nothing commends them for it. If this election is as important as they all say it is, they had a duty to step up. Abraham Lincoln did not shy from the contest of 1860 because of Mary Todd. If Mr. Obama wins in November -- or, rather, when he does -- the failure will lie as heavily on their shoulders as it will with the nominee.\n\nWhat should readers who despair of a second Obama term make of all this? Hope ObamaCare is repealed by the High Court, the Iranian bomb is repealed by the Israeli Air Force, and the Senate switches hands, giving America a healthy spell of Hippocratic government.\n\nAll perfectly plausible. And the U.S. will surely survive four more years. Who knows? By then maybe Republicans will have figured out that if they don\'t want to lose, they shouldn\'t run with losers.\n"
      var orwell = 'Burmese Days\nGeorge Orwell\n\nIt was in Burma, a sodden morning of the rains. A sickly light, like \nyellow tinfoil, was slanting over the high walls into the jail yard. We \nwere waiting outside the condemned cells, a row of sheds fronted with \ndouble bars, like small animal cages. Each cell measured about ten feet \nby ten and was quite bare within except for a plank bed and a pot of \ndrinking water. In some of them brown silent men were squatting at the \ninner bars, with their blankets draped round them. These were the \ncondemned men, due to be hanged within the next week or two. \n\n\nOne prisoner had been brought out of his cell. He was a Hindu, a puny \nwisp of a man, with a shaven head and vague liquid eyes. He had a thick, \nsprouting moustache, absurdly too big for his body, rather like the \nmoustache of a comic man on the films. Six tall Indian warders were \nguarding him and getting him ready for the gallows. Two of them stood by \nwith rifles and fixed bayonets, while the others handcuffed him, passed a \nchain through his handcuffs and fixed it to their belts, and lashed his \narms tight to his sides. They crowded very close about him, with their \nhands always on him in a careful, caressing grip, as though all the while \nfeeling him to make sure he was there. It was like men handling a fish \nwhich is still alive and may jump back into the water. But he stood quite \nunresisting, yielding his arms limply to the ropes, as though he hardly \nnoticed what was happening. \n\n\nEight o\'clock struck and a bugle call, desolately thin in the wet air, \nfloated from the distant barracks. The superintendent of the jail, who \nwas standing apart from the rest of us, moodily prodding the gravel with \nhis stick, raised his head at the sound. He was an army doctor, with a \ngrey toothbrush moustache and a gruff voice. "For God\'s sake hurry up, \nFrancis," he said irritably. "The man ought to have been dead by this \ntime. Aren\'t you ready yet?" \n\n\nFrancis, the head jailer, a fat Dravidian in a white drill suit and gold \nspectacles, waved his black hand. "Yes sir, yes sir," he bubbled. "All \niss satisfactorily prepared. The hangman iss waiting. We shall proceed." \n\n\n"Well, quick march, then. The prisoners can\'t get their breakfast till \nthis job\'s over." \n\n\nWe set out for the gallows. Two warders marched on either side of the \nprisoner, with their rifles at the slope; two others marched close \nagainst him, gripping him by arm and shoulder, as though at once pushing \nand supporting him. The rest of us, magistrates and the like, followed \nbehind. Suddenly, when we had gone ten yards, the procession stopped \nshort without any order or warning. A dreadful thing had happened--a \ndog, come goodness knows whence, had appeared in the yard. It came \nbounding among us with a loud volley of barks, and leapt round us wagging \nits whole body, wild with glee at finding so many human beings together. \nIt was a large woolly dog, half Airedale, half pariah. For a moment it \npranced round us, and then, before anyone could stop it, it had made a \ndash for the prisoner, and jumping up tried to lick his face. Everyone \nstood aghast, too taken aback even to grab at the dog. \n\n\n"Who let that bloody brute in here?" said the superintendent angrily. \n"Catch it, someone!" \n\n\nA warder, detached from the escort, charged clumsily after the dog, but \nit danced and gambolled just out of his reach, taking everything as part \nof the game. A young Eurasian jailer picked up a handful of gravel and \ntried to stone the dog away, but it dodged the stones and came after us \nagain. Its yaps echoed from the jail wails. The prisoner, in the grasp of \nthe two warders, looked on incuriously, as though this was another \nformality of the hanging. It was several minutes before someone managed \nto catch the dog. Then we put my handkerchief through its collar and \nmoved off once more, with the dog still straining and whimpering. \n\n\nIt was about forty yards to the gallows. I watched the bare brown back of \nthe prisoner marching in front of me. He walked clumsily with his bound \narms, but quite steadily, with that bobbing gait of the Indian who never \nstraightens his knees. At each step his muscles slid neatly into place, \nthe lock of hair on his scalp danced up and down, his feet printed \nthemselves on the wet gravel. And once, in spite of the men who gripped \nhim by each shoulder, he stepped slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the \npath. \n\n\nIt is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to \ndestroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to \navoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of \ncutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he \nwas alive just as we were alive. All the organs of his body were working \n--bowels digesting food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues \nforming--all toiling away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be \ngrowing when he stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air \nwith a tenth of a second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the \ngrey walls, and his brain still remembered, foresaw, reasoned--reasoned \neven about puddles. He and we were a party of men walking together, \nseeing, hearing, feeling, understanding the same world; and in two \nminutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone--one mind less, one \nworld less. \n\n\nThe gallows stood in a small yard, separate from the main grounds of the \nprison, and overgrown with tall prickly weeds. It was a brick erection \nlike three sides of a shed, with planking on top, and above that two \nbeams and a crossbar with the rope dangling. The hangman, a grey-haired \nconvict in the white uniform of the prison, was waiting beside his \nmachine. He greeted us with a servile crouch as we entered. At a word \nfrom Francis the two warders, gripping the prisoner more closely than \never, half led, half pushed him to the gallows and helped him clumsily up \nthe ladder. Then the hangman climbed up and fixed the rope round the \nprisoner\'s neck. \n\n\nWe stood waiting, five yards away. The warders had formed in a rough \ncircle round the gallows. And then, when the noose was fixed, the \nprisoner began crying out on his god. It was a high, reiterated cry of \n"Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!", not urgent and fearful like a prayer or a cry for \nhelp, but steady, rhythmical, almost like the tolling of a bell. The dog \nanswered the sound with a whine. The hangman, still standing on the \ngallows, produced a small cotton bag like a flour bag and drew it down \nover the prisoner\'s face. But the sound, muffled by the cloth, still \npersisted, over and over again: "Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram!" \n\n\nThe hangman climbed down and stood ready, holding the lever. Minutes \nseemed to pass. The steady, muffled crying from the prisoner went on and \non, "Ram! Ram! Ram!" never faltering for an instant. The superintendent, \nhis head on his chest, was slowly poking the ground with his stick; \nperhaps he was counting the cries, allowing the prisoner a fixed number-- \nfifty, perhaps, or a hundred. Everyone had changed colour. The Indians \nhad gone grey like bad coffee, and one or two of the bayonets were \nwavering. We looked at the lashed, hooded man on the drop, and listened \nto his cries--each cry another second of life; the same thought was in \nall our minds: oh, kill him quickly, get it over, stop that abominable \nnoise! \n\n\nSuddenly the superintendent made up his mind. Throwing up his head he \nmade a swift motion with his stick. "Chalo!" he shouted almost fiercely. \n\n\nThere was a clanking noise, and then dead silence. The prisoner had \nvanished, and the rope was twisting on itself. I let go of the dog, and \nit galloped immediately to the back of the gallows; but when it got there \nit stopped short, barked, and then retreated into a corner of the yard, \nwhere it stood among the weeds, looking timorously out at us. We went \nround the gallows to inspect the prisoner\'s body. He was dangling with \nhis toes pointed straight downwards, very slowly revolving, as dead as a \nstone. \n\n\nThe superintendent reached out with his stick and poked the bare body; it \noscillated, slightly. "HE\'S all right," said the superintendent. He \nbacked out from under the gallows, and blew out a deep breath. The moody \nlook had gone out of his face quite suddenly. He glanced at his \nwrist-watch. "Eight minutes past eight. Well, that\'s all for this \nmorning, thank God." \n\n\nThe warders unfixed bayonets and marched away. The dog, sobered and \nconscious of having misbehaved itself, slipped after them. We walked out \nof the gallows yard, past the condemned cells with their waiting \nprisoners, into the big central yard of the prison. The convicts, under \nthe command of warders armed with lathis, were already receiving their \nbreakfast. They squatted in long rows, each man holding a tin pannikin, \nwhile two warders with buckets marched round ladling out rice; it seemed \nquite a homely, jolly scene, after the hanging. An enormous relief had \ncome upon us now that the job was done. One felt an impulse to sing, to \nbreak into a run, to snigger. All at once everyone began chattering \ngaily. \n\n\nThe Eurasian boy walking beside me nodded towards the way we had come, \nwith a knowing smile: "Do you know, sir, our friend (he meant the dead \nman), when he heard his appeal had been dismissed, he pissed on the floor \nof his cell. From fright.--Kindly take one of my cigarettes, sir. Do you \nnot admire my new silver case, sir? From the boxwallah, two rupees eight \nannas. Classy European style." \n\n\nSeveral people laughed--at what, nobody seemed certain. \n\n\nFrancis was walking by the superintendent, talking garrulously. "Well, \nsir, all hass passed off with the utmost satisfactoriness. It wass all \nfinished--flick! like that. It iss not always so--oah, no! I have known \ncases where the doctor wass obliged to go beneath the gallows and pull \nthe prisoner\'s legs to ensure decease. Most disagreeable!" \n\n\n"Wriggling about, eh? That\'s bad," said the superintendent. \n\n\n"Ach, sir, it iss worse when they become refractory! One man, I recall, \nclung to the bars of hiss cage when we went to take him out. You will \nscarcely credit, sir, that it took six warders to dislodge him, three \npulling at each leg. We reasoned with him. "My dear fellow," we said, \n"think of all the pain and trouble you are causing to us!" But no, he \nwould not listen! Ach, he wass very troublesome!" \n\n\nI found that I was laughing quite loudly. Everyone was laughing. Even the \nsuperintendent grinned in a tolerant way. "You\'d better all come out and \nhave a drink," he said quite genially. "I\'ve got a bottle of whisky in \nthe car. We could do with it." \n\n\nWe went through the big double gates of the prison, into the road. \n"Pulling at his legs!" exclaimed a Burmese magistrate suddenly, and burst \ninto a loud chuckling. We all began laughing again. At that moment \nFrancis\'s anecdote seemed extraordinarily funny. We all had a drink \ntogether, native and European alike, quite amicably. The dead man was a \nhundred yards away.'
      var science='Neuroscientists create \'atlas\' showing how words are organised in the brain\nIan Sample, The Guardian\n\nScientists have created an \"atlas of the brain\" that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ.\n\nLike a colourful quilt laid over the cortex, the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white matter.\n\n\"Our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one specific aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics, or the meanings of words,\" said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nNo single brain region holds one word or concept. A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words. And each single word lights up many different brain spots. Together they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love; death and taxes; clouds, Florida and bra. All light up their own networks.\n\nDescribed as a \"tour de force\" by one researcher who was not involved in the study, the atlas demonstrates how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks. With further advances, the technology could have a profound impact on medicine and other fields.\n\n\"It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading, or possibly even thinking,\" said Alexander Huth, the first author on the study. One potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neurone disease or locked-in syndrome to speak through a computer.\n\nTo create the atlas, the scientists recorded people\' brain activity while they listened to stories read out on The Moth Radio Hour, a US radio show. They then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.\n\nHuth used stories from The Moth Radio Hour because they are short and compelling. The more enthralling the stories, the more confident the scientists could be that the people being scanned were focusing on the words and not drifting off. Seven people listened to two hours of stories each. Per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words- and more than 3,000 different words - as they lay in the scanner.\n\nThe atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain. For example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word \"victim\". The same region responds to \"killed\", \"convicted\", \"murdered\" and \"confessed\". On the brain\' right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: \"wife\", \"husband\", \"children\", \"parents\".\n\nEach word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings. One part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word \"top\", along with other words that describe clothing. But the word \"top\" activates many other regions. One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places. The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.\n\nStrikingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the participants, suggesting that their brains organised the meanings of words in the same way. The scientists only scanned five men and two women, however. All are native English speakers, and two are authors of the study published in Nature. It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.\n\nArmed with the atlas, researchers can now piece together the brain networks that represent wildly different concepts, from numbers to murder and religion. \"The idea of murder is represented a lot in the brain,\" Gallant said.\n\nUsing the same haul of data, the group has begun work on new atlases that show how the brain holds information on other aspects of language, from phonemes to syntax. A brain atlas for narrative structure has so far proved elusive, however. \"Every time we come up with a set of narrative features, we get told they aren\'t the right set of narrative features,\" said Gallant.\n\nUri Hasson, a neuroscientist at Princeton University, praised the work. Unlike many studies that looked at brain activity when an isolated word or sentence was spoken, Gallant\' team had shed light on how the brain worked in a real-world scenario, he said. The next step, he said, was to create a more comprehensive and precise semantic brain atlas. Ultimately, Hasson believes it will be possible to reconstruct the words a person is thinking from their brain activity. The ethical implications are enormous. One more benign use would see brain activity used to assess whether political messages have been effectively communicated to the public. \"There are so many implications, and we are barely touching the surface,\" he said.\n\nLorraine Tyler, a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University said the research was a \"tour de force in its scope and methods\". But the brain atlas in its current form does not capture fine differences in word meanings. Take the word \"table\". It can be a member of many different groups, says Tyler. \"It can be something to eat off, things made of wood, things that are heavy, things having four legs, non-animate objects, and so on. This kind of detailed semantic information that enables words to be used flexibly is lost in the analysis,\" she said. \"While this research is path-breaking in its scope, there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.\"'
