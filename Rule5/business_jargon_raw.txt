Algorithmic trading
In its simplest terms this is trading without the
involvement of humans. To take an example,
when an investor-driven trader (such as a pension
fund) wants to buy stocks in large quantities,
to avoid aff ecting the market price they will often
use specially developed computer algorithms to
spread the investments in such a way that market
prices remain unaff ected as much as possible.
It would be simply impossible for a human trader
to respond as quickly to market information as
a computer can.
Alternative investment
Traditional investments include stocks, bonds,
cash or property. An alternative investment is
basically anything else. The term includes art,
wine and antiques, but most signifi cantly
fi nancial assets such as private equity (stocks
in a company not publicly traded on a stock
exchange) and fi nancial derivatives (agreements
that derive their return from the performance
of an underlying asset like a stock or bond).
Analyst

exploiting their diff erent prices to guarantee
a profi t regardless of the outcome.
Assets

Asset Management
We have a whole section on this, but in brief, this
is the professional management of investments.
Fund managers/asset managers invest in the
fi nancial markets on behalf of their clients to achieve
attractive returns. The asset manager will discuss
with the investor (or client) what kinds of investments
they would like to make and set realistic goals for
returns. Once the funds have been transferred from
the investor to the asset manager, then that asset
manager will place those funds where he/she thinks
the return will be maximized over a given period.
Audit
The professional examination and verifi cation
of a company’s accounting data.
Automation

involved in generating revenue, e.g. Technology,
Operations and Human Resources. The back
offi ce is also responsible for the processing of

around the world that mandate regulation to

Bulge bracket
In common parlance, a bulge bracket fi rm is an
investment bank considered to be one of the
largest and most profi table in the world. The name
comes from the practice of listing these banks at
the top of the ‘tombstone’. A tombstone is an
advertisement formally announcing a particular
transaction – perhaps an off ering or placement of
stock of a company. The bank’s name at the top
of the tombstone will typically be in a larger font
and will therefore ‘bulge’ out.
Bull
An individual who expects the value of a commodity,
bond, share, currency, sector or market to rise.

building. Blocks might also be put in place on
emails and phone calls between these areas. This
is a general business term, not unique to banking.
Clearing
Confi rming the details of a transaction between
traders as well as managing the transfer of
payment and delivery of the relevant certifi cates
and documentation.
Clearing house
A separate agency or corporation working with
the commodity exchange (where commodities

event is an occurrence relating to a debt
obligation not being met. An obvious example is
a company going bankrupt. Others include failure
to pay, restructuring and moratorium (the law
deciding that debt repayments can be delayed
due to extenuating circumstances). Derivatives
based on these credit events will payout to the
investor if the company concerned exhibits one
of these conditions.
GLOSSARY OF TERMS 03
Credit correlation
The measure of how the default risk of one
company moves in relation to that of another.
Credit derivative

Derivative
An agreement that derives its value from an
existing bond, share, currency or commodity
(referred to as the base instrument or underlying
investment). The price of a derivative will move in
direct relationship to the price of the base
instrument. Derivatives involve the trading of
rights or obligations based on the underlying
product, but do not directly transfer property.
They are used to hedge risk or to exchange a
fl oating rate of return (linked to a reference rate
that is outside of the control of either party, such
as LIBOR – the London Interbank Off ered Rate) for
fi xed rate of return (an agreed rate that does not
change).

Exchange
A place for companies to publicly and centrally
off er their investment options to investors. For

on these products – these will include things like
futures, options and other more complex
derivatives.
Exchange-traded fund (ETF)
An ETF is similar to a mutual fund, in that
investors own a share of a pool of securities and
other assets. The diff erence here is that shares in
an ETF can be bought or sold throughout the day,
much like normal stocks and shares.

of directors or trustees to monitor the progress of
the fund and to ensure it is being run to the
greatest benefi t for investors.
Nearshoring
Off shoring is the practice of moving a business
service to a provider in another country. However,
there are instances in which greater distance or
time-lag is not desirable for the eff ective running

a better solution. This is when the service is
outsourced to a business in a neighboring
country – making contact easier and more
effi cient while also reducing overall running
costs.
Operational risk
The risk of loss associated with inadequate or
failed internal processes, staff , systems, external
events or legal matters.
GLOSSARY OF TERMS 07

market. The portfolio of a private equity fund will
typically include traditional assets such as bonds,

million dollars, the lender needs to know that it
can pay that money back. It will take many things
into account including the credit history of the

Short position
The practice of making money on a security
whose value is expected to fall. A short seller
identifi es a security, let’s say a share in a
company, which he or she thinks is about to fall
in price. He/she borrows the share from a broker
and sells it at the current price. If, as expected,
the price of that share falls, he/she then buys the
share back at the lower price and gives the share
back to the broker. He/she will be subject to a
borrowing fee charged by the broker, but if the
share fell by a signifi cant amount, the short seller
has made money. All of this means the security
being traded must be fungible: that is to say, the
security’s value can be substituted by another
security of the same type. Currency, for example,
is fungible; if you borrow $10 from someone, you
can give them back any $10 note – it doesn’t
have to be the same one they gave you.
Spot market
A public fi nancial market in which trades are
completed for immediate delivery, as opposed to

year will be within -6% and +7%”.
